//! The protocol between `derisk installer` and the program that installs.
//!
//! derisk draws the installer; it does not know how an operating system is
//! put on a disk. That is the backend's: a program the installer starts and
//! talks to in JSON lines, requests on its stdin and events on its stdout.
//! LosOS's backend is `losos-installer serve`, which lays the disk out with
//! systemd-repart and fills it with systemd-sysupdate; any other system can
//! supply its own.
//!
//! The backend speaks first, with [`Event::Hello`], and answers each
//! [`Request`] with events. An install sends [`Event::Step`] and
//! [`Event::Line`] as it goes and ends with [`Event::Installed`] or
//! [`Event::Failed`]. What the backend prints to stderr goes to the journal.
//!
//! ```text
//! → {"event":"hello","name":"LosOS Desktop","source":"https://…"}
//! ← {"method":"disks"}
//! → {"event":"disks","disks":[{"path":"/dev/vda","name":"vda","model":"","size":21474836480,"removable":false}]}
//! ← {"method":"install","disk":"/dev/vda"}
//! → {"event":"steps","labels":["Partitioning the disk","…"]}
//! → {"event":"step","index":0,"count":4,"label":"Partitioning the disk"}
//! → {"event":"line","text":"…"}
//! → {"event":"installed"}
//! ← {"method":"reboot"}
//! ```
//!
//! Getting online is not the backend's: the installer joins networks itself
//! (see [`crate::network`]), since a live system and an installed one do
//! that the same way.
