//! First-boot setup: what `derisk setup` asks before anyone can log in, and
//! the commands that save the answers.
//!
//! A freshly installed system has no users (LosOS has no account in its
//! image; a user is a systemd-homed home area), so the first boot asks for a
//! language, a keyboard layout, a time zone, a network and the first account,
//! and then hands the screen to the login screen. This module holds the
//! steps and their rules without a toolkit, so they can be tested headless;
//! `derisk setup` draws them with [`crate::wizard`].
